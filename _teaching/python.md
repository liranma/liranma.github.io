Course Overview
======
The goal of this course is to give the students a working knowledge of how to use Python to perform data analytics. We will introduce Python data structures (e.g., strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, NumPy ndarrays, and Pandas DataFrames) and ways to manipulate data (e.g., selection, iteration, and visualization). Students will design, implement, and test Python programs.

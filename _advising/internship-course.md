CPT
======
* To work off-campus as an intern, you will need apply for CPT (Curricular Practical Training). To qualify for CPT, you will need to take CITE 40450 (Computing Internship). The course can be taken with variable credits (ranging 1-3), while you cannot take more than 3 credits in total.  Hypothetically, if you take one credit each summer (or a regular semester), you can take the course three times.
 
* To enroll in the internship course, you will need to secure an intern position first. Then, have your internship supervisor email  the assigned course instructor detailing the technical nature of your intern work. Upon receiving the email, we will evaluate whether it would be appropriate for the internship course. If so, you will be given a permission number to enroll. For example, to work as an intern in summer 2022, you can enroll CITE 40405 either in Summer 2022 or Fall 2022.

* After enrolling in the course, the assigned course instructor can sign the Part II of the CPT application form (https://internationalservices.tcu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1.5.1.4-updated-CPTform.pdf) for you.
